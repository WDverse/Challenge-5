# My Portfolio


## Description


This webpage shows my portfolio. It has a codbase that follows accessibility  standards. The webpage contains some information about me, links to my works, and to contact me. Through this project, I realised that it's ideal to group elements appropriately into containers to enable seamless application of css properties. Media queries also allow for greater control over responsiveness.
